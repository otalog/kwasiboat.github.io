This study explores the complex relationship between companies ESG performance and market efficiency, particularly during periods of market shocks, such as the 2020 pandemic. Through empirical analysis, the research finds that ESG criteria not only serve as ethical benchmarks but also offer potential risk mitigation benefits, enhancing liquidity, price discovery, and information efficiency. Further findings suggest that companies prioritizing ESG principles may exhibit greater resilience during market downturns. These insights underscore the potential of ESG investing as a strategy for navigating financial volatility, offering a promising alternative to traditional market interventions like short selling bans.
