Currently the best way to achieve an efficient chain of distribution for third party refrigerated logistics companies is the use of optimization technique in computer-based software. This work introduces the greedy search method to solve a capacitated vehicle route problem integrated by means of travelling salesman problem concept and to minimize transport cost at the same time. The model is used to locally optimize route, and we also used a single truck to cover all customers located within a certain distance limit. To obtain possible set of routes for each vehicle, permutations and combinations are used. Route distances and vehicle distances are formed using the greedy search method with increasing number of customers. By means of critical path method, we presented computational results on a set of routes and we identified optimal routes which are more efficient for despatching of cold food. Finally, we imputed these optimal distances into a transportation cost function to find the optimal cost. This model will provide a theoretical basis in planning vehicle path for cold chain logistics and despatching activity for distribution centres and also to minimize cost.
