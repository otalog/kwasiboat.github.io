Sample Student Comments: <br>
* The lecturer/tutor was highly professional, demonstrated deep knowledge of the subject, and was always willing to provide extra support outside of class to address questions or concerns.
* One of the strongest aspects of Wesley Deng’s teaching is his ability to break down complex topics into manageable parts and connect them with practical, real-world examples.
* He explains concepts with clarity and teaches effectively. I have gained a great deal of understanding from his classes.
* Kwasi presented the material very clearly and structured the course well. He was transparent about assessments and always approachable and helpful when students asked questions.
* Kwasi is an amiable and passionate teacher. His tutorials are logically structured, easy to follow, and enriched my financial knowledge significantly.
* He is a warm and engaging lecturer whose explanations are clear and easy to understand. His teaching made challenging concepts accessible.
* I particularly valued his “big picture” approach, which provided an overview of each week’s lecture before delving into details. As a visual learner, this method helped me perform better in the course. His use of real-world examples also made the subject of financial markets more meaningful and easier to grasp.
